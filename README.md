# Bloons Tower Defense 6: Farming Script

## What Is It?

Repeatedly plays "Deflation" mode on the map "Infernal." Each game takes just under 6 minutes (10-11 games/hr). 

This is *not* a mod, and does not connect with the game in any way; it controls your keyboard and mouse to play the game like a normal player would.

## Limitations

- Currently cannot train water monkeys
- Unpurchased monkey upgrade paths will stall script
- Updated as of BTD6 update 43; new maps since then may break the script and new monkeys since then will be missing

### Performance Numbers

- Earns account levels/monkey knowledge (~600,000 XP/hr)
- Earns tower XP (varying rates)
- Earns monkey money (600-700 money/hr)

## Requirements

### Modes/Maps

- Expert-difficulity map "Infernal" unlocked
- "Infernal: Easy" beaten
- "Infernal: Primary only" beaten
